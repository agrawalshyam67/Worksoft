## Introduction
The ideation and implementation of the idea to build a startup and proffering it to the real industry
is carried out in the Planspiel project under the Faculty of Computer Science – Technische
Universität, Chemnitz. The whole work structure of Planspiel is interesting as it empowers an
individual with entrepreneurship abilities. It makes learning fun as it puts students into the
corporate shoes and makes them strong in both management and technical aspect of building a
prosperous and dwelling IT company in the upcoming future.
The workflow of Planspiel contains various challenging activities like team building, creation of
team website, creating a logo for the team which accurately resembles the characteristics of team
and its aim followed by various managerial and technical activities which at the end will result in
a unique product development experience for each individual of the team in a different manner
and allow each individual to polish their existing knowledge and also acquire new during this
entire Planspiel phase.

## Problem Statement
A student who is pursuing a master program from the university, he or she needs to acquire
sublime knowledge of the processes well as the procedures related to the program. One of the
most important segment of this program is Master Thesis. The main focus of the thesis is that a
student should be able to think scientifically and technically on the topic being assigned as a
part of the program.
The problem arises when the student comes across new queries related to decisions on methods,
implementation of solution to the problems and formulation.
In order to make the process easy and hassle free, certain workflow or diagram needs to be
developed which in turn could help the students taking the decision wisely. We will generalize
the process with the help of detailed instructions in the form of BPMN (business process model
and notation), optimize the queries in the current workflow and find out the process that can be
automated, which helps the student to successfully enroll in master thesis program. Similarly,
there are various other important workflows or processes in the university the student finds
difficult to understand when he/she enter fresh into any of the university program. Our system
not only focuses on the Thesis workflow but also other simple or complex workflows of the
university which help the user tackle these kind of problems arriving in daily life.
For our system as mentioned earlier the prime focus being the Thesis workflow we concentrate
on other workflows too like Subject Enrollment, Exam Registration, Library System. These are
the most common workflows among any group of users and are not limited to any department
or course in the university. These systems and there BPMN model will be well defined in our
product description where we will provide a detailed view of how and what problems our
product addresses.

WorkSoft is a child of meetyourIT solutions available on our website. It is a client side frontend
web-based software system running to solve issues related to business workflows. This software
is currently in its development phase and working on an university problem statement. Current
operations being implemented include optimizations and simplification of university’s common
student related workflows like Thesis Project, Exam Registration, Subject Registration, Library
system and etc. The main idea behind this system is that both type of users in an university i.e. the
students as well as the professors can have an easy access to information related to any of these
flows and can keep a track of their progress in any particular workflow. On the other hand the
professors can have information available on their end about the students and their associated
workflows, keeping track of students’ progress, have tabular information helping the professors
to have a pre-sorted view of categorized information. This systems will work in accordance with
our values we promise to provide to our customers i.e. this workflow software system will be a
win-win situation for both the parties working with our system. The students will have a single
place where they can have their progress efficiently tracked and also selection of multiple
workflow choices between all simple or complex processes he/she has to undergo in the entire
curriculum of university degree program. Similarly, the professors can also have one place where
they can have all necessary information of students available and allowing professor to have
control over the progress of students and administrative control over student workflows.
